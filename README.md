# Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon Services - Code Refactoring

## Description

This challenge, as part of a bootcamp course, was to refactor the provided code for a hypotethical business. 
Using the starter code, I updated and ammended the html and css code, ensuring that it was following best practices to improve accessibilty.

To improve the code I:
- ensured all images had alternative text
- consolidated and combined the number classes where possible 
- ensured all links worked as intended
- updated 'div' tags to appropriate semantic tags where possible
- added comments to assist with clarity
